Exciting documentation in here.
Let's make a list (empty surrounding lines required):

- item 1

  - nested item 1
  - nested item 2

- item 2
- item 3

Another list can be made as:

1. Somethng
2. Maybe something more
3. Third input line

    1. Enumerated sublist
    2. which has multiple lines

      - and a sub list as well
      - with two lines

3. And twice the same number...
4. This might be stupid....
